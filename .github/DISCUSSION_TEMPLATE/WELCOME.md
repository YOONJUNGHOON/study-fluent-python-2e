## 👋 Welcome!  This is the Discussions space for our Fluent Python 2nd Edition study repo.
  We’re using Discussions as a place to connect with other members of our community. We hope that you:
  * Feel free to post freely any general questions or discussions that come up during the study!
  * Share ideas and your thoughts!
  <span style="color:red">
  * For suggestions or ideas related to study structure, planning, operations, or GitHub feature improvements, please post them in the Issues tab!
  </span>
  * Let’s do our best in the study, friends! 💪🔥

  For the maintainers, here are some tips 💡 for getting started with Discussions. We'll leave these in Markdown comments for now, but feel free to take out the comments for all maintainers to see.

  📢 **Announce to your community** that Discussions is available! Go ahead and send that tweet, post, or link it from the website to drive traffic here.

  🔗 If you use issue templates, **link any relevant issue templates** such as questions and community conversations to Discussions. Declutter your issues by driving community content to where they belong in Discussions. If you need help, here's a [link to the documentation](https://docs.github.com/github/building-a-strong-community/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository#configuring-the-template-chooser).

  ➡️ You can **convert issues to discussions** either individually or bulk by labels. Looking at you, issues labeled “question” or “discussion”.
